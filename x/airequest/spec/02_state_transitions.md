# State Transitions

In this section, we describe the transition process & the corresponding updates to the states of the airequest module

The state transitions are described below:

1. [AIRequest](./02_state_transitions.md#airequest)

## AIRequest
Since other systems may reuse the AIRequest state, there is no state transition for it. Once stored, there will be no further changes.
